The Boston Neighborhood Change Explorer is maintained by the BPDA Research Division. For any questions or feedback regarding this tool, please submit a Research Inquiry on [our website](https://www.bostonplans.org/research/).

For further analysis of demographic and housing trends in Boston, see our [Historical Trends in Boston's Neighborhoods](https://www.bostonplans.org/research/research-publications?search=historical+&amp;sortby=date&amp;sortdirection=DESC) report, where most of the data on this website were originally published.

Data on this website are drawn from 1950-2020 Decennial Censuses and the 2006-2010 and 2016-2020 American Community Surveys. 

### A note on Boston's total population

The City of Boston, working with the BPDA Research Division, successfully challenged the 2020 Decennial Census' count of Boston's total population, which was disrupted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Census has acknowledged that Boston's 2020 group quarters population was underestimated by 6,290 people. Those additional people will be reflected in the Census' yearly population estimates for Boston starting in FY2023. 

On this website, "Total Population" data for 2020 are adjusted in order to include the additional people from the group quarters challenge, putting Boston's total 2020 population at 681,937 people. 

To adjust Boston's 2020 decennial population to account for the successful group quarters challenge, the BPDA Research Division allocated the city's net group quarters population to tracts and neighborhoods using the locations of dormitories and correctional facilities where those populations were mis-estimated in the 2020 decennial census. These allocations were apportioned by sex based on citywide male-to-female ratios for students in dormitories and people in correctional facilities. 

However, our data on Boston's additional group quarters population do not include detailed demographic information, so this website's data on race/ethnicity reflect unadjusted 2020 decennial census counts. Additioanlly, the population categories for other demographic variables on this website may add up to different estimated totals of Boston's 2020 population because their data come from the American Community Survey's 2016-2020 5-Year estimates rather than from the 2020 decennial census.

### Crosswalk Methodology 

The smallest available geography for some variables is the Census tract. Therefore, Boston's neighborhood boundaries are approximated using 2020 Census tract boundaries.<sup>1</sup> The Census Bureau, however, has changed the boundaries of its Census Tracts across the decades. We use the most recent map of Census Tracts (from the 2020 Census), then where necessary, we interpolate data from earlier years’ Census Tracts to conform to the tracts from 2020.

When Census Tracts change, we use that year’s population by Census Block, the smallest geographic unit available in the Census, to create population weights that are used to apportion populations from earlier years to 2020 Census Tracts. In cases where Census Blocks overlap the boundaries of 2020 Census Tracts, the share of block land area on either side of the 2020 tract boundary is incorporated into the weights. In earlier years, when Census Block boundaries are not available, we use a modified method that employs 1990 Census Block geography, the oldest year available.

While there were a fair number of tract boundary changes over the full time period we study, the majority of these boundary changes occur within the larger neighborhood geographies, rather than between them. In these cases, the boundary changes do not affect the numbers shown on this website, as both portions of the divided tract are aggregated into the same neighborhood.

The methods used here are similar to those used in the commercially available Neighborhood Change Database (NCDB), produced by the Urban Institute and Geolytics, and the public use Longitudinal Tract Database (LTDB) produced by the American Communities Project. Because our geographic scope is limited to Boston, we are able to extend our crosswalk back over a longer time period than either of these sources, and to cover a larger set of variables than is available from the NCDB. Our method also uses block-level population weighting for all years, whereas the LTDB uses area-based weighting for earlier years. Creation of our crosswalk was greatly aided by the availability of historic tract and block-level GIS shapefiles from the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) at the Minnesota Population Center.

##### <sup>1</sup> Because they cannot be separately identified at the Census tract level, the Leather District is combined with Downtown and Bay Village is combined with the South End. Census Tract 9815.02 is partially in East Boston and partially in Revere, but almost the entire population is in Revere so it is excluded from the East Boston approximation.
