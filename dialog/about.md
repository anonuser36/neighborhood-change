The Boston Neighborhood Change Explorer was built by the BPDA Research Division. For any questions or feedback regarding this tool, please submit a Research Inquiry on [our website](https://www.bostonplans.org/research/).

For summary tables by neighborhood and topic and for further analysis of demographic and housing trends in Boston, see our [Historical Trends in Boston's Neighborhoods](https://www.bostonplans.org/research/research-publications?search=historical+&amp;sortby=date&amp;sortdirection=DESC) reports, where most of the data on this website were originally published.

### Data sources

Most of the data on this website are drawn from 1950-2020 Decennial Censuses and the 2006-2010 and 2016-2020 American Community Surveys.

Housing unit counts beyond 2020 are calculated by combining 2020 decennial data with Mayor's Office of Housing data on net new units (based on City of Boston building permits) between April 1, 2020 (the date of the 2020 decennial census) and the present. The Mayor's Office of Housing is also the source of the data on housing sales presented here, using data originally compiled and processed by the Warren Group.

For the Children by Race and Ethnicity topic, some values from 1980 and 1990 were imputed (estimated) in order to have more consistent race & ethnicity categories over time. See the "Imputation Methodology" section below for a description of this process.

The topics on business establishments and business loans are reported for "zip code areas", a set of geographic boundaries based on Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) that we designed to allow for better correspondence between tract-level FFIEC Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) data on business loans and zipcode-level business establishment data from the Census. See the "Businesses and Loans Methodology" section below for a description of this correspondence.

### A note on Boston's total population

The City of Boston, working with the BPDA Research Division, successfully challenged the 2020 Decennial Census' count of Boston's total population, which was disrupted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Census has acknowledged that Boston's 2020 group quarters population was underestimated by 6,290 people. Those additional people will be reflected in the Census' yearly population estimates for Boston starting in FY2023. 

On this website, "Total Population" data for 2020 are adjusted in order to include the additional people from the group quarters challenge, putting Boston's total 2020 population at 681,937 people. 

To adjust Boston's 2020 decennial population to account for the successful group quarters challenge, the BPDA Research Division allocated the city's net group quarters population to tracts and neighborhoods using the locations of dormitories and correctional facilities where those populations were mis-estimated in the 2020 decennial census. These allocations were apportioned by sex based on citywide male-to-female ratios for students in dormitories and people in correctional facilities. 

However, the data on Boston's additional group quarters population do not include detailed demographic information, so the data on race/ethnicity and age presented here reflect unadjusted 2020 decennial census counts. Additionally, the population categories for other demographic variables on this website may add up to different estimated totals of Boston's 2020 population because their data come from the American Community Survey's 2016-2020 5-Year estimates rather than from the 2020 decennial census.

### Crosswalk Methodology 

The smallest available geography for some variables is the Census tract. Therefore, Boston's neighborhood boundaries are approximated using 2020 Census tract boundaries.<sup>1</sup> The Census Bureau, however, has changed the boundaries of its Census Tracts across the decades. We use the most recent map of Census Tracts (from the 2020 Census), then where necessary, we interpolate data from earlier years’ Census Tracts to conform to the tracts from 2020.

When Census Tracts change, we use that year’s population by Census Block, the smallest geographic unit available in the Census, to create population weights that are used to apportion populations from earlier years to 2020 Census Tracts. In cases where Census Blocks overlap the boundaries of 2020 Census Tracts, the share of block land area on either side of the 2020 tract boundary is incorporated into the weights. In earlier years, when Census Block boundaries are not available, we use a modified method that employs 1990 Census Block geography, the oldest year available.

While there were a fair number of tract boundary changes over the full time period we study, the majority of these boundary changes occur within the larger neighborhood geographies, rather than between them. In these cases, the boundary changes do not affect the neighborhood-level numbers shown on this website, as both portions of the divided tract are aggregated into the same neighborhood.

The methods used here are similar to those used in the commercially available Neighborhood Change Database (NCDB), produced by the Urban Institute and Geolytics, and the public use Longitudinal Tract Database (LTDB) produced by the American Communities Project. Because our geographic scope is limited to Boston, we are able to extend our crosswalk back over a longer time period than either of these sources, and to cover a larger set of variables than is available from the NCDB. Our method also uses block-level population weighting for all years, whereas the LTDB uses area-based weighting for earlier years. Creation of our crosswalk was greatly aided by the availability of historic tract and block-level GIS shapefiles from the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) at the Minnesota Population Center.

##### <sup>1</sup> Because they cannot be separately identified at the Census tract level, the Leather District is combined with Downtown and Bay Village is combined with the South End. Census Tract 9815.02 is partially in East Boston and partially in Revere, but almost the entire population is in Revere so it is excluded from the East Boston approximation.

### Imputation Methodology (Children by Race and Ethnicity)

In 1980, the primary technique used by the Census to ensure the privacy of individual respondents was to suppress (withhold from publication) certain cells and tables of data that fell below minimum thresholds for population. For census tracts in Suffolk County, MA, the most common racial categories for counts of children to be suppresssed were the Asian American/Pacific Islander, American Indian, and Other Race categories. We estimated numbers of children within each tract for any race by age categories for which population counts were suppressed, using the baseline assumption that the shares of children belonging to each racial category in a given tract should be proportional to the shares of the total (all-ages) population belonging to each category in that tract.

Additionally, the only racial categories for Hispanic children for which population data were published in the 1980 tract-level decennial tables are White, Black, and a category for all other races. We estimated numbers of Hispanic children in the Asian American/Pacific Islander, American Indian, and Other racial categories, again assuming that the shares of non-white, non-black Hispanic children belonging to each of these categories in a given tract are proportional to the shares of the total (all-ages) Hispanic population belonging to these categories in that tract. These estimated Hispanic race by age counts were then subtracted from the total populations of each race by age category in order to infer numbers of non-Hispanic children in each category, ensuring that the racial & ethnic category totals displayed on this tool for 1980 add up to age group totals and better match how race & ethnicity are identified in later censuses.

As a basic quality check, we summed up our imputed tract-level counts of children for each race/ethnicity by age category in Suffolk County and found that they are very close to the counts reported in county-level 1980 Census tables. For most categories, this difference was less than 0.5%, and the biggest difference was 2%. However, the degree of over- or under-estimation of populations for particular race/ethnicity by age categories in 1980 may be greater for individual tracts or neighborhoods, to the degree that our assumptions about the racial composition of children being comparable to that of the population as a whole don't hold up in those places. 

In 1990, the Census moved away from suppression and started using a different set of techniques for ensuring respondent confidentiality, meaning that we didn't have to impute any baseline race by age counts. However, in 1990, published population counts of Hispanic children are not disaggregated by race at either the tract or county levels, meaning that reporting non-Hispanic race by age population counts required imputation of race by age counts for Hispanic children. For these estimates, we again used the baseline assumption that the share of Hispanic children belonging to each racial category in a given tract is proportional to the share of the total Hispanic population in that tract belonging to each racial category. 

### Businesses and Loans Methodology (Zip Code Areas)

To provide an approximate correspondence between business dynamics and small business loan activity, we aimed to present the topics of business establishments and small business loans within a common unit of geography. However, historical data on business establishments from the Census' Zip Code Business Patterns program are reported at the zip code level, while small business loans data from the FFIEC's Community Reinvestment Act program are reported at the census tract level.

Zip codes do not have inherent polygon geography, since some represent institutional delivery addresses or PO Box locations. The Census provides Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) polygons to facilitate analysis of zip code data. We assigned the business establishments from every zip code that didn't directly correspond with a 2020 ZCTA polygon to the 2020 ZCTA that contains that zip code's location. For example, data for zip code area 02116 (roughly corresponding with the Back Bay neighborhood) include establishments that use zip code 02116 as well as businesses using zip code 02117 (a PO Box zip code located in Back Bay). 

However, because some ZCTAs don't correspond well with the census tract boundaries, some ZCTAs were subsequently combined with each other in order to provide a better geographic correpondence with census tract boundaries. This step mostly assigns small institutional ZCTAs to their larger neighbors, with 02163 (Harvard's Boston campus) being folded into 02134 (Allston), 02199 (the Prudential Center) being folded into 02116 (Back Bay), and 02203 (South Station) being folded into 02111 (Chinatown/Leather District). However, several larger ZCTAs in downtown Boston with complex shapes were also combined to create the "Zip Codes 02108-10" area (consisting of ZCTAs 02108, 02109, 02110, 02203, and 02133). Each zip code area thus represents one or more 2020 ZCTA polygons.

The FFIEC reports CRA small business loan data for each year using nominal census tract boundaries, with years 1990-2002 using 1990 tract boundaries, years 2003-2011 using 2000 tract boundaries, and 2012-2021 using 2010 tract boundaries. We assigned each tract to the zip code area within which a majority of its land area is contained. Data on small business loans for a given zip code area therefore may not always correspond exactly with zip code area boundaries, and there are a handful of zip code areas and years for which changes in loan activity between census tract vintages may partially reflect tract boundary changes.
